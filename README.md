# weshare.click

Weshare.click is a simple file-sharing application that you can self-host on AWS and use as an alternative to file-transfer services such as WeTransfer or Dropbox Transfer.

This application was built from scratch by [Eoin](https://twitter.com/eoins) and [Luciano](https://twitter.com/loige) on a series of live streams as part of the [AWS Bites](https://awsbites.com) show. The full playlist (6 episodes / ~8 hours) is [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAWXFhe0N1vI1_z-06EzJ22pz95_gBrId).

The idea was to showcase how to build a real application using AWS, Serverless, and Node.js. The application is still minimal but usable.


## What are the use cases?

Imagine that you have a file you want to share with others, or even with yourself on another device. You don't want to use Google Drive, Dropbox, or any of the public cloud services, perhaps because they are blocked in some way.
This codebase will allow you to deploy your own, branded file-sharing service!


## Features

 - Upload a file using REST APIs or a CLI application
 - Ability to use a custom domain
 - Authentication (OAuth 2.0 & OAuth 2.0 device flow)

The feature set is still minimal, but it gives you a fully functional and usable backend.

If there's any feature that you'd like to see here, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/awsbites/weshare.click/issues/new) or, even better, [a PR](https://github.com/awsbites/weshare.click/compare).


## Current Architecture

The current architecture makes use of the following services:

  - **Lambda** for the backend
  - **API Gateway** for the API
  - **Cognito User Pool** for authentication
  - **S3** for file storage (using pre-signed URLs)
  - **Route53** and **ACM** to manage your custom domains and certificates


A high-level [architecture diagram](./arch-diag.png) is available in this repository.

The CLI authentication uses the OAuth 2.0 device authentication flow, which is not supported by Cognito by default, so we built a shim on top of the built-in Cognito OAuth 2.0 code flow. A [diagram](./auth-flow.png) that showcases how that works is available.


## Installation guide

### Requirements

  - Your AWS account
  - The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with the right credentials to deploy to your AWS account
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
  - [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework) (v3 or higher)
  - Your custom domain (easier if already registered with Route53)
  - A bash-compatible environment (Tested on Mac OSx but it should also work on Linux and Windows with subsystem for Linux)


### 1. Get the code & dependencies

The first step is to get the code locally by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:awsbites/weshare.click.git
```

Now you can run the following script to download the necessary dependencies for every package:

```bash
./setup.sh
```
